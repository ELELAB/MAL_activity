The repository contains the input data for docking and mutational scan calculations, outputs from analyses and associated scripts to reproduce our data.
The raw data from the high-throughput scan are avaialable upon request due to space limitations.

A more detailed README file is in each subfolder (i.e. mutations, docking)
